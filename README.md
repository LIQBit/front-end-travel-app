# Final Project - "Travel Buddy"
Final Project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree course. The goal of this project was to create a "travel app" where users can input the name of a city and their departure date and receive information such as an image of the city, weather forecasts for both the arrival date and now, and some information about the location such as its country, currency, language and even national flag.

The project was built in Webpack to help with the production process as well as bundling and minifying and uses Express for its server. The server receives and sends data from four API's: [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/), [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/), and [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/).

**Installation**

You will need node.js to install. Go to the node.js website for instructions on how to install node for your operating system.

Use npm installer to install all necessary packages, dependencies and plugins for the project. Once inside the npm installer, simply type
```
npm install

```
The relevant packages and dependencies will be installed.

**Necessary API Keys**

In order for the app to function, you will need to obtain API keys from [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/), [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/), and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).
